# Handle Route Errors

## My Notes

A Remix [ErrorBoundary](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/error-boundary)
component works just like normal React
[error boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary),
but with a few extra capabilities. When there is an error in your route component,
the `ErrorBoundary` will be rendered in its place, nested inside any parent routes.
`ErrorBoundary` components also render when there is an error in the `loader`
or `action` functions for a route, so all errors for that route may be handled in one spot.

To obtain the thrown object, you can use the `useRouteError` hook.

```tsx
const error = useRouteError()
```

👨‍💼 If you open <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username.tsx" /> and
comment in one of the errors Kody 🐨 added for you,
then try loading <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" />, you'll notice the error
looks pretty bad. We definitely want to customize that!

Could you please add an `ErrorBoundary` component
to <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username.tsx" /> so we can handle
errors that happen there in our app?

Please make sure to log the error in the console with `console.error` so we can
see what's going on in our debugging.

As a reminder, here's an example of what an error boundary looks like:

```tsx filename=app/routes/errors-oh-no.tsx
import { useRouteError } from '@remix-run/react'

export function ErrorBoundary() {
	const error = useRouteError()
	console.error(error)

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Oh no!</h1>
			<p>Something bad happened! Sorry!</p>
		</div>
	)
}
```
