# Actions

## My Notes

For actions, `DataFunctionArgs` can be replaced with `ActionFunctionArgs`.

Action loader takes two parameters, `request` and `params`. From request we can
extract the form values, `title` and `content`. From params we can extract `username` and `noteId`.
We then use `title` and `content` to update the note in the database.

Once that is done, we redirect back to the note's page using the full URL.

üë®‚Äçüíº Just like our `loader` responds to `GET` requests for data, the `action`
responds to non-`GET` requests for data. The `action` accepts the same
parameters as the `loader` and is expected to return a `Response`. It's also
typically expected to return a `redirect` or a `json` response and can use the
same utilities.

So now, we want you to get the `formData` from the `request` and use it to
update the note, and then redirect back to the note's page.

	Don't worry about doing any validation or error handling. We'll cover that
	later. Additionally, we'll handle the TypeScript errors in the next step.
