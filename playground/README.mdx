# Static meta export

## My Notes

We can add and set properties that go into the `<head />` of the page inside the `App` function
in the `app/root.tsx`. This can be even done without using the Remix `<Meta />` component.
I found it interesting that we can put `className` in the `head` element.

👨‍💼 Have you gotten a look at the browser tab for our app? It looks like
nonsense! Let's at least add a nice title. Also, we should probably set a couple
other configuration bits of metadata as well.

💰 Note, we're not going to use the Remix `<Meta />` component yet. We're just
rendering things directly in the `<head>` for now.

```html
<title>My Page</title>
<meta name="description" content="This is my page" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```
