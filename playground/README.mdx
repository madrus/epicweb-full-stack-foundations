Remix has its own form component, `Form`, that simplifies the process of building
forms. For the moment, it looks like syntactic sugar to me but I am sure there will be more to come.

👨‍💼 We need to add support for editing notes. You'll be required to make a form
for the notes edit page. In this first step we're only expecting you to make the
form itself, don't worry about making it work yet (Remix won't let you anyway).

The emoji will be your guide through this exercise!
